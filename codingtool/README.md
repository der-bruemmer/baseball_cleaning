# Codingtools to reate smiles on pictures

This project includes 2 python codingtools that:
* load a number of pictures contained in the pictures folder
* display each picture and show dialogues to reate the smiles, either if it's a true/fake smile or its smile intensity.
* persist the choices of the rater as a csv file

The tools need Pillow installed and are written in Python3.
