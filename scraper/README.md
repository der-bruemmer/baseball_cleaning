# Chrome WebScraper extension config files

Procedure for Scraping:

* install Chrome WebScraper extension
* press F12 to find WebScraper
* Create new sitemap -> import sitemap
* paste one of the configurations
* select new sitemap
* Sitemap -> scrape -> start scraping

To scrape only the 1951 season teams, use sitemap\_51.json, otherwise use sitemap\_all.json.

After scraping has finished, you can export the data as CSV.

Scraping takes 2.5 seconds for each player, so scraping all of them takes a long time.
